# ENTERTAINMENT ENNUI: BODEGAS BECOME BORING BOROUGH BUSINESS; ONLY GAMES WILL MAKE GREATER GAINS!

**Reported by `Official Mayor-Endorsed News` on `24 October 2022`**

Citizens in the world _must be amused_ in order to stay happy. As the Mayor commented with clear intent for O.M.E.N. to report, "the people of `term-world` are only of any value to me if they are complacent. We want prestiege; we want popularity; we want...PIZZAZZ!"

So get your doo-dads, gadgets, and widgets underway, folks; it's time to engage in some _entertainment_. Since built, the once-promising neighborhood bodegas have experienced marginal business. To reap the full benefit of the Mayor's original economic stimulus plan, the `bodega`s strewn throughout `term-world` need a few landmark draws to keep kids spending their easily-obtained quarters, and the people generally distracted.

Citizens await the latest crop of cool new games to emerge from the latest effort to excite local economies. Will yours be the next big thing to come from `term-world`? Will it fill that hard-to-define, missing niche in citizens' souls only quenchable by playing past the _next_ level? Will it have, dare we write, PIZZAZZ?

## Overview

In this activity, you'll:

* learn more about `import`ing packages
* use packages to extend program functionality
* practice developing a moderately complex concept in the form of a game

Here, you must:

* _copy_ (we **stress** _copy_) the `AmusementTemplate.py` file to your `bodega` department
* _rename_ (we also **stress** _rename_) the file `Amusement.py`
* develop a concept for a department- or bodega-themed game
* use any (or all) of the following `3` modules:
  * `random`
    * you're going to want to make a casino game; I implore you to reconsider
  * `json`
    * if using this library, each `bodega` departmnet has a `data` folder with _tons_ of fun data
    * you _may_ choose to create your own data file; if choosing this option, place the file in the `bodega` folder in `data`
    * this will likely require at least a brief conversation with a TL or the instructor
  * `rich`
    * this was not covered by the video, but has documentation [found here](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* use at least `2` additional `if` statements
* use either a `for` or `while` loop
* use at least `2` additional `function`s
* add a post (see `site/_posts`) to your `bodega` site which is dated correctly and ends in `game.md`
  * for example, if we made our post _today_: `2022-10-24-games.md`

The above outlines _minimum_ requirements. It's very likely that you'll need to go beyond that to create the game you've planned.

As with previous assignments, there are plenty of opportunities for improvements to items and the larger `bodega` structure. Some, however, will be more apt for future weeks. I'll let you know in our discussion if that's true, but you may feel free to improve the larger `bodega` as well.

The Mayor reserves the right to deem an improvement too small and to request changes.
